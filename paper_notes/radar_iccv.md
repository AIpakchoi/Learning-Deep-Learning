# [Vehicle Detection With Automotive Radar Using Deep Learning on Range-Azimuth-Doppler Tensors](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/CVRSUAD/Major_Vehicle_Detection_With_Automotive_Radar_Using_Deep_Learning_on_Range-Azimuth-Doppler_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf)

_November 2019_

tl;dr: Deep radar perception on radar FFT data.

#### Overall impression
Directly regress oriented bbox (maybe it is even upright bbox) on front radar. This is similar to [deep radar detector](deep_radar_detector.md)

#### Key ideas
- Summaries of the key ideas

#### Technical details
- The doppler cues does not help too much (~1% increase)

#### Notes
- Questions and notes on how to improve/revise the current work
