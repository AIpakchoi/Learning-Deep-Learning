# [EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11946.pdf)

_June 2019_

tl;dr: Scaling network up jointly by resolution, depth and width is a wiser way to spend inference budget. 

#### Overall impression
The paper proposed a simple yet principled method to scale up networks. The main difference from previous work is the exploration of image resolution in addition to network architecture (width and depth). 

The EfficientNet-B0 is similar to MnasNet. Scaling this network up pushes the pareto frontier for imageNet significantly, achieving similar accuracy with x10 reduction in FLOPs and parameters.
