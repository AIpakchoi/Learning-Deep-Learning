# [LeGR: Filter Pruning via Learned Global Ranking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12368.pdf)

_May 2019_

tl;dr: Learn a global ranking metric for layers so pruning filters is just as easy as thresholding this measure. Better than Auto Model Compression (AMC).

#### Overall impression
Previous methods use costly methods to find the Pareto front of performance-resource tradeoff curve. **Resource-Constrained filter pruning** is the main topic of this study.

NAS is a bottom up approach, but more resource demanding. Top-down approach, such as pruning or quantization are more practical.
