# [3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shapes](http://3dshapenets.cs.princeton.edu/paper.pdf)

_Mar 2019_

tl;dr: A convolutional deep belief network (CDBN) is trained to perform recognition and retrieval of 3D voxel grid.

#### Overall impression
The paper builds upon deep belief network popular at that time and uses a new way to train 3D network. It also achieves several other tasks, such as 2.5D joint classification and completion, and next best-view prediction. However it is surpassed by many other methods later such as MVCNN and the famed PointNet.

This paper is from CVPR 2015, only 4 years old as of the time of writing but I am already having difficulty going through this paper as smoothly as other more recent papers, due to the archaic terminology and method.
