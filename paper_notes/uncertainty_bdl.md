# [What Uncertainties Do We Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04977.pdf)

_June 2019_

tl;dr: A new DL framework to deal with two uncertainties (aleatoric and epistemic) simultaneously.

#### Overall impression
Describe the overall impression of the paper. 

#### Key ideas
- Two main kinds of uncertainty
	- Epistemic uncertainty
		- Measures what your model doesn’t know
		- Can be explained away by unlimited data
	- Aleatoric uncertainty
		- Measures what you can’t understand from the data
		- Can be explained away by unlimited sensing
