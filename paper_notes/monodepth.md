# [monodepth: Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Left-Right Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03677)

_July 2019_

tl;dr: Seminal paper on monocular depth estimation with stereo

#### Overall impression
This paper is one pioneering work on monocular depth estimation with self-supervision. 

When people are talking about monocular depth estimation, they mean "monocular at inference". The system can still rely on other supervision at training, either explicit supervision by dense depth map GT or with self-supervision via consistency.

The paper is superceded by [monodepth2](monodepth2.md), which focuses on depth estimation from monocular video.
