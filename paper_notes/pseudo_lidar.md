# [Pseudo-LiDAR from Visual Depth Estimation: Bridging the Gap in 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07179.pdf)

_Mar 2019_

tl;dr: Estimate depth map from RGB image (mono/stereo) and use it to lift RGB to point cloud. The point cloud representation uses depth information more efficiently and steps toward bridging the gap between camera based approach and lidar based approach.
