# Learning-Deep-Learning
This repository contains my learning notes and the code snippets (in iPython Notebook or Python script format). The iPython notebook files are initially forked from [this repo](git@github.com:jessicayung/self-driving-car-nd.git) based on the Udacity course, but was heavily adopted with new notes and necessary changes to accommodate new API changes.
